# Who am I ?

Hi world! I am Vivek, Data scientist and Analyst by profession and training
currently working at Stockholm university. I am skilled at analytical and numerical modeling
and love doing all sorts of fun things with data like hunting for facts and weaving a visual story
out of it. My recent favorite: [VisualCapitalist](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/), a great platform
showcasing what's possible with data.
