# Who am I ?

Hi world! I am Vivek, a physicist with a Ph.D. in computational/numerical physics,
specializing in applying advanced mathematical techniques to complex problems.
I spend my days as a fullstack data scientist. I am skilled in analytical and numerical modeling
and love doing all sorts of fun things with data like hunting for facts and weaving a visual story
out of it. My recent favorite: [VisualCapitalist](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/), a great platform
showcasing what's possible with data.
